    <h2>Coding Capabilites</h2>
    <div class="iconcontainer">
      <img class="icon-codingcapabilities" src="pics/icons/pythonIcon.jpg" alt="Python" title="Python" data-text="Python was my first programming language. I started with multiple Codecademy courses, reaching topics like Data Analysis, Statistics and Visualization. Since 2022, I use Python to tackle algorithmic challenges and create small projects for fun. I have solved over 75 Project Euler Challenges, created a calculator and more! Currently, Python is the language I am the most proficient in.">
      <img class="icon-codingcapabilities" src="pics/icons/cIcon.jpg" alt="C" title="C" data-text="C was my second programming language. In my studies, we used C for a whole semester to understand algorithms and data structures. I got to know a more basic and static approach to programming, which was a lot of fun to me. I learned to work with pointers, memory, trees, linked lists, hash tables, graphs, sorting algorithms, and more!">
      <img class="icon-codingcapabilities" src="pics/icons/javaIcon.jpg" alt="Java" title="Java" data-text="In the summer of 2023, I aquired basic knowledge about Java and its use. I really like its object-oriented part and when I have time, I would love to create some complex and connected classes to build something cool!">
      <img class="icon-codingcapabilities" src="pics/icons/htmlIcon.jpg" alt="HTML" title="HTML" data-text="Learning HTML was an essential part to build this website of mine. I worked with a lot of trial and error, especially using CSS, but in the end, I am happy to say that I learned HTML by myself.">
      <img class="icon-codingcapabilities" src="pics/icons/cssIcon.jpg" alt="CSS" title="CSS" data-text="Learning CSS was an essential part to build this website of mine. I worked with a lot of trial and error since there were times where getting the right formatting was quite a challenge.">
      <img class="icon-codingcapabilities" src="pics/icons/javascriptIcon.jpg" alt="JavaScript" title="JavaScript" data-text="I completed a Scrimba course about JavaScript and used it to build my website and some other small projects, which you can find below.">
    
      <img class="icon-codingcapabilities" src="pics/icons/mongodbIcon.png" alt="MongoDB" title="MongoDB" data-text="I completed a Codecademy course about MongoDB and acquired basic knowledge about NoSQL databases. They have sparked my interest and in the future, I will surely inquire more about them.">
      <img class="icon-codingcapabilities" src="pics/icons/sqlIcon.png" alt="SQL" title="SQL" data-text="I first completed a Codecademy course about SQL to learn the language and to acquire basic knowledge about relational databases. Afterwards, we looked further into SQL in the Database Systems course at the university of Zurich.">
      <img class="icon-codingcapabilities" src="pics/icons/react_icon.svg" alt="React" title="React" data-text="In the spring of 2024, I used React to build a group project at university. You can find the project below.">

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div class="projecticoncontainer">
      <img class="icon-projects" src="pics/icons/calculator_icon.svg" alt="Calculator" title="Calculator" data-text="My very first programming feat was a calculator. I used python and its integrated module tkinter. The first challenge was to design and build a graphical user interface (GUI), placing buttons at the right place with the right size and so on. When this was achieved, I began implementing the calculator's functionality from scratch. The entered signs and numbers were stored in an array and calculated once the '=' sign was pressed. I ended up restricting the user input in certain situations, so that the user could only continue with a mathematically correct input.I had a lot of fun thinking from two perspectives: the user's and the developer's. This project enhanced my understanding of event-driven and user-friendly programming.">
      <img class="icon-projects" src="pics/icons/get-together_icon.svg" alt="Get-Together, a web app for trip planning" title="Get-Together, a web app for trip planning" data-text="Get-Together is a group project of 5 students at the university of Zurich. We created a trip planning web app where people can plan trips with friends, choose public transport connections and organize who will do what and who will take what with them. Feel free to take a look at it " linking='https://sopra-fs24-group-11-client.oa.r.appspot.com/'>
      <img class="icon-projects" src="pics/icons/website_icon.svg" alt="Website" title="Website" data-text="My latest project is this website you're currently on. I thought to myself that I wanted to learn something new and showcase my capabilities to the world. Thus, I began coding, without knowing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, and arrived at the current static website you're seeing. The process was sometimes hard but mostly fun, since I directly saw the results of my work. During the months of October and November, I regularly added more information until I reached a satisfying end-product. However, it is to say that I still update the website and stand open for any suggestions for improvement you may have. I really hope you like the contents and the design. If you happen to have any feedback, I would be glad to hear it!">
