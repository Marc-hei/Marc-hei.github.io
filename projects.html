            <div class="text-101"><span class="orange">QR Code Generator</div>
            <div class="text-102">Ongoing</div>
            <div class="text-103">The QR Code Generator is a utility tool I'm building in JavaScript to convert any string (URLs, messages, or identifiers) into a scannable QR code. I initially started this project to deepen my understanding of how encoding formats like UTF-8 and QR error correction levels (L, M, Q, H) are implemented. I'm focusing on writing modular code that can later be extended to support different styling options (color, size, embedded logos) or bulk generation. This project is strengthened my skills in both front-end and data encoding logic.</div>

            <div class="text-101"><span class="orange">Passkey Implementation</div>
            <div class="text-102">Ongoing</div>
            <div class="text-103">This project is a deep dive into the future of secure authentication: Passkeys. I'm working on implementing WebAuthn to replace traditional passwords with cryptographic keys stored securely on the device. My main motivation is to understand how underlying algorithms like FIDO2, public-private key cryptography, and attestation work in real-world authentication flows. This project is giving me a much deeper understanding of user identity and zero-trust security models.</div>

            <div class="text-102">Spring 2024</div>
            <div class="text-103">Get-Together is a web app for trip planning. This group project of 5 students at UZH was created in need of a trip planning web app where friends can plan trips together. It is possible to choose public transport connections with the help of the transport open data API, organize tasks and decide who is responsible for bringing what. The platform has many interactive features and is quite fun to use! Unfortunately, we are only rarely hosting the platform and it is turned off most of the time. If you're lucky, you can still find it <span class="blue bold"><a href="https://sopra-fs24-group-11-client.oa.r.appspot.com/" target="_blank">here</a></span>.</div>

            <div class="text-101"><span class="blue">This Website</div>
            <div class="text-102">Since 2023</div>
            <div class="text-103">In 2023, I created this website you're currently on. I thought to myself that I wanted to learn something new and showcase my capabilities to the world. Thus, I began coding, without knowing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, and arrived at the current static website you're seeing. The process was sometimes hard but mostly fun, since I directly saw the results of my work. It is to say that I still update the website and stand open for any suggestions for improvement you may have. I really hope you like the contents and the design. If you happen to have any feedback, I would be glad to hear it!</div>

            <div class="text-101"><span class="blue">Shopping List</div>
            <div class="text-102">Fall 2023</div>
            <div class="text-103">I built <span class="blue bold"><a href="https://mkh-foodapp.netlify.app/" target="_blank">this</a></span> simple web app to help users manage grocery and to-do lists. It was an exercise in building dynamic front-end functionality using vanilla JavaScript, including form handling and list rendering. Moreover, I recently added database support and login functionality with firebase. Though basic, this project taught me a lot about web development and gave me my first sense of how user interaction shapes design decisions. I often use this because I like its UI, so come check it out as well!</div>

            <div class="text-101"><span class="blue">Blackjack</div>
            <div class="text-102">Fall 2023</div>
            <div class="text-103"><span class="blue bold"><a href="https://mkh-blackjackgame.netlify.app/" target="_blank">This</a></span> was one of my first interactive JavaScript projects. I created a playable version of Blackjack, complete with score handling, card logic, and simple animations. The goal was to apply conditional logic and loops in a fun way while introducing the game principles. It was both a playful and productive way to build confidence in coding fundamentals.</div>
