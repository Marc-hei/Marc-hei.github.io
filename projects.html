            <div class="text-103">QR Codes are fascinating because they are so simple yet so powerful and used everywhere. The largest versions can already store almost up to 3kB of data! I started this project to understand how QR codes are built, and I'm learning how encoding formats like UTF-8 and QR error correction levels are implemented. I try to write modular code that I can afterwards extend to support different styling options (color, size, embedded logo).</div>

            <div class="text-103">This project focuses especially on exploiting binaries in Linux systems to gain unauthorized access and elevate privileges. In the Information Security Lab, I studyied different techniques to exploit ulnerable SUID/SGID binaries. The goal was to deeply understand system security weaknesses from an attacker's perspective to build more robust and resilient defenses.</div>

            <div class="text-103">Tamarin is a powerful tool used to formally verify security protocols, giving mathematical assurance that they are secure. In the Information Security Lab, I modelled and analyzed cryptographic protocols to prove properties like authentication, agreement and secrecy. I learned that protocols that seem logically secure may not always be in the presence of a Dolev-Yao network adversary.</div>

            <div class="text-103">SCION is a future Internet architecture designed to be secure, available, and robust by design, addressing major security issues of the current BGP-based Internet. In the Network Security class, I explored its fundamental concepts, such as path-aware networking, control-plane isolation, and trust root delegation. The project involves setting up a SCION environment and communicating over its channels.</div>

            <div class="text-102">Summer 2025</div>
            <div class="text-103">The future of secure authentication are Passkeys. In a group of two, we implemented WebAuthn to replace traditional passwords with cryptographic keys stored securely on the device. Our main motivation was to understand how underlying algorithms like FIDO2, public-private key cryptography, and attestation work. This project granted us a much deeper understanding of user identity and zero-trust security models. For reference, we also added normal username & password logins as well as 2FA!</div>

            <div class="text-103">Get-Together is a web app for trip planning. This group project of 5 students at UZH was created in need of a trip planning web app where friends can plan trips together. It is possible to choose public transport connections with the help of the transport open data API, organize tasks and decide who is responsible for bringing what. The platform has many interactive features and is quite fun to use! Unfortunately, we are only rarely hosting the platform and it is turned off most of the time. If you're lucky, you can still find it linked below.</div>

            <div class="text-103">In 2023, I created this website you're currently on. I thought to myself that I wanted to learn something new and showcase my capabilities to the world. Thus, I began coding, without knowing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, and arrived at the current static website you're seeing. The process was sometimes hard but mostly fun, since I directly saw the results of my work. I really hope you like the contents and the design. If you happen to have any feedback, I would be glad to hear it!</div>

            <div class="text-103">Sure, you can always just use the built-in notes app or a piece of paper to make your grocery lists. However, my this site is a better alternative. I often use it because I like its UI, so check it out as well! I built all the front-end functionality using vanilla JavaScript and I added database support and login functionality with firebase. Though basic, this project taught me a lot about web development and gave me my first sense of how user interaction shapes design decisions.</div>

            <div class="text-103">I dived into 3D rendering with three.js for a very short time. The result is a "realistic" path of Torii gates with some stones, grass, and sand along the way. The website is only a minimal subset of the large space of 3D rendering and it would definitely be fun to explore more of it.</div>

            <div class="text-103">This web game was one of my first interactive JavaScript projects. I created a simple version of Blackjack with score handling, card logic, and simple animations. The goal was to experience the gist of front-end development. It was both a playful and productive way to build confidence in coding fundamentals.</div>
