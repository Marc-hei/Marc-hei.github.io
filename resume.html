      <div class="introduction">
        <p class="text-103">Hi, my name is Marc. I am 22 years old and I just finished my Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics at UZH. Now it is time to go deeper into the field of informatics, especially cyber security. I'm now starting a joint Master's degree at ETHZ and EPFL in Cyber Security!</p></p>
        <p class="text-103">Why did I study <span class="blue">Business Informatics</span>? The interdependence between the worlds of IT and Business are fascinating. While IT focuses on the technical aspects of information systems and infrastructure, Business emphasizes strategy, operations, and market dynamics. The synergy between these realms is crucial for an organization's present and future. The successful integration of IT and Business allows for innovation, efficiency, and competitive advantage, showcasing the necessity of skills in both technology and strategy in the modern business environment. In my Minor (30 ECTS), I study Banking & Finance. The financial world has caught my interest in the early years of my life and I am eager to learn more about markets, risks, accounting and audit in my further studies.</p>
        <p class="text-103">Why do I want to study <span class="blue">Cyber Security</span>? In today's increasingly digital and interconnected world, cybersecurity has become a cornerstone of both organizational resilience and individual safety. I am deeply intrigued by the challenge of securing systems against ever-evolving threats and understanding the mechanisms behind digital vulnerabilities. Cyber Security uniquely blends technical depth with strategic thinking, offering the opportunity to protect assets, privacy, and data integrity on a global scale. I am motivated by the idea of not only defending infrastructures but also proactively contributing to safer digital ecosystems. With a strong foundation in informatics and a solid understanding of business operations, I believe I can bring a holistic approach to solving security challenges in both corporate and societal contexts.</p>

      <p>
      As a Security Specialist in Asset Transfer at UBS, I played a vital role in orchestrating the secure and efficient movement of financial assets among clients and different organizations. During my time at UBS, the company prioritized an agile and flexible mindset, and I actively contributed to increase productivity while protecting sensitive information throughout the asset transfer process. I became adept at balancing the need for speed with the necessity for robust security measures.
      <br><br>
      In close collaboration with diverse teams and other banks, my role involved the transfer of different types of assets: Shares, Bonds, Funds, and more complex products like Derivatives, Precious Metals or Hedge Funds.This job allowed me to develop a comprehensive skill set in handling diverse asset classes
      <br><br>
      In this role, I learned a lot: I fulfilled various clients' needs, collaborated with co-workers or different counterparties, and  managed to meet volume expectations by giving it my all.
      <br><br>
      For seven weeks, I supported the Expense Management Team in reducing their workload. In this position, I was responsible for many co-workers and had to study their expenses by checking their expenses for consistency and verity.
      </p>
    
      <p>
      I attended Kantonsschule Uster, dedicating six years to a curriculum focused on Economics and Law. While the school provided a robust foundation in these disciplines, there were unfortunately limited opportunities to delve into the concepts of informatics.
      <br><br>
      My interest in economics was clear from my school days, but I found informatics equally intriguing. Faced with the choice, I decided to pursue both by studying business informatics at the University of Zurich, aiming to explore the best of both worlds.
      </p>

      <p>
      My decision to apply for a teaching assistant position in Mathematics came naturally after successfully completing the course during my first year at the University of Zurich. Eager to share my knowledge and teach new students many mathematical concepts, I found myself fit for the challenge.
      <br><br> 
      The topics of the module were Sets, Relations, Functions, Sequences and Series, Differential Calculus, and Integral Calculus. For thirteen weeks straight, I held two 90-minutes sessions for two diverse groups of 20 to 30 students on-site.
      <br><br> 
      My goal was to prepare the students that visited my lessons as best as I could for the approaching exam. Since I had experience from the previous year, I could give helpful study tips and explain the topics in a more understandable way.
      <br><br> 
      This experience not only strengthened my own understanding of the subject matter but also fueled my passion for teaching and learning.
