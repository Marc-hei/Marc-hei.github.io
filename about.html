  <h2>Some Facts About Me</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class="mytext">
      Hi, my name is Marc. I am 21 years old and I study Business Informatics at the University of Zurich. Currently, I am in the fifth semester of my bachelor's degree.
    </li>
    <li class="mytext">
      Why am I studying this curriculum? The interdependence between the worlds of IT and Business are fascinating. While IT focuses on the technical aspects of information systems and infrastructure, Business emphasizes strategy, operations, and market dynamics. The synergy between these realms is crucial for an organization's present and future. The successful integration of IT and Business allows for innovation, efficiency, and competitive advantage, showcasing the necessity of skills in both technology and strategy in the modern business environment. Additional information can be found <a href="#studying" class="cool-link">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li class="mytext">
      I love to learn and to teach. As a student, I am surrounded by intellectual and cognitive challenges all the time. At the same time, I share my knowledge in mathematics as a tutor for first-year students and in skiing as a ski instructor for young kids. Feel free to read more <a href="#skiing" class="cool-link">below</a>.
    </li>
    <li class="mytext">
      In my Minor (30 ECTS), I study Banking & Finance. The financial world has caught my interest in the early years of my life and I am eager to learn more about markets, risks, accounting and audit in my further studies.

    </li>
    <li class="mytext">
      In my leisure time, I like to do two things: Firstly, I often explore places in the outside world to broaden my cultural and geographical horizon. Secondly, I enjoy tackling algorithmic challenges, engaging in small projects, and constructing meaningful solutions - whether it's overcoming complex coding hurdles or crafting my own website.
    </li>
    <li class="mytext">
      Upon completing my bachelor's degree at UZH in spring 2025, I plan on either continuing with a master's degree in a related file or to enter the workforce for a year, seeking valuable practical experience in the landscape of IT and businesses.

      <p class="about-text">
        Since 2020, I have immersed myself in the world of ski instruction, dedicating my days to teaching the art of skiing to 7-12-year-old children. Guiding these young enthusiasts through the snowy slopes is a funny and rewarding journey, as I could witness their progression to confident, successful skiers as well as their social and cognitive growth.
        <br><br>
        Beyond honing their technical skills, my role extends to keeping children save, ensuring fairness and a sense of camaraderie, as well as coping with children's lifes, problems and joys.
        <br><br>
        My joy for skiing stems from my childhood, where I was an athlete myself.
