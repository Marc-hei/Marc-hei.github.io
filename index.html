          <p class="text-101">Hi, I'm <span class="green bold">Marc</span>, a passionate <span class="green bold">cybersecurity</span> engineer. Let's talk about hardening your <span class="green bold">digital defenses</span> and keeping your data <span class="green bold">safe</span>.</p>
        </aside>
          

        <p class="text-103">I am a Master's student in Cybersecurity <span class="blue bold">@<a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ethz.ch" target="_blank">ETHZ</a>/<a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.epfl.ch">EPFL</a></span>. You wonder why I'm studying cybersecurity? That's easy to answer! In today's increasingly digital and interconnected world, attacks can come from anywhere. If you think you are secure, please reassess, as this illusion can change instantly. An organization must be aware of their surroundings at all times, constantly monitoring irregular network or host activity. I am deeply interested in protecting assets, systems, privacy, and data integrity against ever-evolving threats.</p>
        <p class="text-103">I recently finished my Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics <span class="blue bold">@<a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.uzh.ch" target="_blank">UZH</a></span>. Why did I study Business Informatics? Nowadays, information technology (IT) has become central to every organization. If you don't know how to properly utilise it, you lose out on tremendous potential gains. With my studies, I am able to assess the usage of IT, align them with business strategies, and bring upon efficiency gains. Having skills in both technology and strategy is a critical advantage in the modern business environment. In my Minor (30 ECTS), I studied Banking & Finance, learning more about the financial world such as markets, risks, accounting and auditing.</p>

        <p class="text-102">My current interests</p>
      </aside>
      <p class="text-103">
        I am particularly interested in web security, cryptography, and networks. Web applications are ubiquitous and often the primary interface between users and services, making them prime targets for attackers. Cryptography is the backbone of secure communication in the digital age. Lastly, networks enable efficient and secure communication among the whole world.
      </p>
      <p class="text-103">
        A deep understanding of these topics is the key to building a safer digital environment. It enables me to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information, and to protect sensitive data and maintain user trust.  
      </p>
      

      <aside>
        <p class="text-102">Why I built this website despite knowing that a personal portfolio is a double-edged sword</p>
      </aside>

      <p class="text-103">
        A personal portfolio is more than just a website; it is your digital footprint. It is very useful for showcasing your skills to recruiters and coworkers. It can serve as a resume and allows you to showcase your projects and experiences in a way a PDF never could. A well-crafted site helps you stand out in a crowded field, proves your expertise, and facilitates networking.
      </p>
      <p class="text-103">
        However, such an online presence is not without its risks. This is particularly true in the cybersecurity field, where the line between "sharing" and "leaking" is especially thin. Every detail you publish, no matter how trivial it may seem, serves as a data point for those you would rather not attract. Because every piece of information can be weaponized against you, I have been pretty selective about what appears on this site. What I have chosen to leave out is just as important as what I have chosen to include.
